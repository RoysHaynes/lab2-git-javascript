[!Warning] The Markdown listing with code fence close syntax like
``` 
within a markdown file is a problem. Many Markdown parsers have workarounds like an extra 
backtick, but many don't. In this case I added a space that you'd need to remove!
Remember, sweat the details, and now there are sharp points and little gotchas all
over the place.
